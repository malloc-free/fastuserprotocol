Version 0.1.24 of TestBed, authored by Michael Holmwood

TestBed carries out tests on 5 different protocols: TCP, UDP, UDT, uTP and DCCP.
The implementations for TCP, UDP and DCCP are those found in the Linux kernel. 
The author for the UDT lib is Yunhong Gu, and is provided in this project as
a shared library. The uTP lib is provided by BitTorrent, Inc. The licences for
each can be found in the lib directory.

Machine Requirements:

Large file sizes will require that much free memory for the tests to run 
properly (reading from swap will affect the results somewhat).

Dependencies:

The TestBed does have a couple of dependencies, some of which are going to be
redundant soon, and removed.

Generic Data Structures Library (GDSL):

home page: home.gna.org/gdsl/
docs: home.gna.org/gdsl/1.7/html/
code: download.gna.org/gdsl

This dependancy will be removed shortly, as I am going to be using the glib
hashtable and queue implemetations instead.

glib2.0:

On debian, its just apt-get install libglib2.0-0 libglib2.0-dev
